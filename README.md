# Angular Native Sdk Sample Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Dependencies

The sample application needs the following packages:
- Transifex Native Javascript SDK (@transifex/native)
- Transifex Native Angular SDK (@transifex/angular)

If @transifex/angular is under development, you can install it with the command:

```
npm install file:../tx-angular-native-sdk/dist/tx-angular-native-sdk/transifex-angular-0.0.1.tgz
```

## Getting started

You need a "reasonably recent" version of node/npm to run this application.

In order to get started, you can run:

```sh
# Will install all packages listed in package.json
npm install

# Will run the 'start' script from package.json, which compiles the application
# and starts a development server
npm run start
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Change the languages using the language picker and see the translations being rendered in real time.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
